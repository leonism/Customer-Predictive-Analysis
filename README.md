# Customer Predictive Analysis

# Installation
On this repository, you may find my personal projects related to Machine Learning, EDA, Python Jupyter Notebook and couple of Visualization based on the Dataiku Platform exported standard files. Most of the datasets I've been working with, downloaded from Conundrum site. Installation pretty straight forward. Simply download the whole set as a single project and as a ZIP file, everything have been flattened out with plain text files, and no SQL dump was involved, so there wouldn't be any missing system dependencies issue. Simply imported the downloaded Zip file to your working project.

# Correlation Matrix

The very first correlation analysis consists of plotting the "Correlation matrix" for numerical variables. For each couple of numerical variables, this computes the "strength" of the correlation (called the Pearson coefficient):

- 1.0 means a perfect correlation
- 0.0 means no correlation
- -1.0 means a perfect "inverse" correlation

Since it does not really make sense to print this correlation plot for hundred of variables, we are restricting it to the first 50 numerical variables of the dataset.
