# Customer Predictive Analysis
Customer analytics is a process by which data from customer behavior is used to help make key business decisions via market segmentation and predictive analytics. This information is used by businesses for direct marketing, site selection, and customer relationship management. Marketing provides services in order to satisfy customers. With that in mind, the productive system is considered from its beginning at the production level, to the end of the cycle at the consumer. Customer analytics plays an important role in the prediction of customer behavior.

## Retail
Although until recently over 90% of retailers had limited visibility on their customers, with increasing investments in loyalty programs, customer tracking solutions and market research, this industry started increasing use of customer analytics in decisions ranging from product, promotion, price and distribution management.[citation needed] The most obvious use of customer analytics in retail today is the development of personalized communications and offers and/or different marketing programs by segment.[citation needed] Additional reasons set forth by Bain & Co. include: prioritizing product development efforts, designing distribution strategies and determining product pricing.[3] Demographic, lifestyle, preference, loyalty data, behavior, shopper value and predictive behavior data points are key to the success of customer analytics.

## Retail Management
Companies can use data about customers to restructure retail management. This restructuring using data often occurs in dynamic scheduling and worker evaluations. Through dynamic scheduling, companies optimize staffing through predictive scheduling software based on predictive customer traffic.  Worker schedules can be adjusted in response to updated forecasts at short notice. Customer analytics allows retail companies to evaluate workers by comparing daily sales to daily traffic in a store.  The use of customer analytics data affecting the management of retail workers in a phenomenon known as refractive surveillance. The model of refractive surveillance describes how the collection of information on one group can affect and allow for the control of an entirely different group.


# Installation
On this repository, you may find my personal projects related to Machine Learning, EDA, Python Jupyter Notebook and couple of Visualization based on the Dataiku Platform exported standard files. Most of the datasets I've been working with, downloaded from Conundrum site. Installation pretty straight forward. Simply download the whole set as a single project and as a ZIP file, everything have been flattened out with plain text files, and no SQL dump was involved, so there wouldn't be any missing system dependencies issue. Simply imported the downloaded Zip file to your working project.

# Correlation Matrix

The very first correlation analysis consists of plotting the "Correlation matrix" for numerical variables. For each couple of numerical variables, this computes the "strength" of the correlation (called the Pearson coefficient):

- 1.0 means a perfect correlation
- 0.0 means no correlation
- -1.0 means a perfect "inverse" correlation

Since it does not really make sense to print this correlation plot for hundred of variables, we are restricting it to the first 50 numerical variables of the dataset.

Been enjoying exploring this dataset for sure, and certainly it was fun doing it, stays safe everyone! ðŸ˜Š
